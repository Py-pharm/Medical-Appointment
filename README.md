# Medical-Appointment

## Introduction

Missed outpatient appointments are a common problem for clinics, and reducing their rate improves office efficiency, income, and resident education.

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

In this project, we intend to explore the dataset and identify specific reasons using the variables why some patients missed outpatient appointments and then provide insight into developing targeted approaches to reducing their rates.
